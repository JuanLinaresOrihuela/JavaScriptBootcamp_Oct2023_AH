// Task: Identify the longest of three names.

// Build Specifications:
// Start with three variables name1, name2, and name3 which hold three names.

// The code should output the longest of the three names. e.g., "Ada Lovelace has the longest name.".
// If there is a tie between any two, list both. e.g., “Charles and Brendan tie for the longest name.”. 
// Or if all three names are the same length, output “All three names, Dorothy, Charles, and Brendan, are 
// the same length.”

// Make sure to test your code with many different combinations of lengths. There are 7 possible outcomes.

// Hint:
// First write the code for just two names. In that case there are only three possible outcomes. Then expand it for three names.

let name1 = "Juan";
let name2 = "Casey";
let name3 = "Emilia";

function longestName(name1, name2, name3) {
    
}
